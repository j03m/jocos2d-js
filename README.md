jocos2d-js
==========

This is a series of tools built in conjunction with our next game Heroes of the Rift for cocos2d-html5.

This release probably isn't fully functional without some game files from hotr, but there are some neat tools like JCScrollingLayer, JCTouchLayer, JCUiElements and JCUtils that should be.

It's also still pretty messy as we lead up to release, but I wanted to get it out into the world before I got too busy.

This is currently only tested with cocos2d-html5, but we'll add support for cocos2dx-js shortly. 

Watch this space.
