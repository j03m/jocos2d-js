jocos2d-js
==========

This is a series of tools built in conjunction with our next game RiftSummoner for cocos2d-html5. Techdemo at http://www.riftsummoner.com 

Tools for jocos2d-js. Most of the tools here are fully functional and should be stand alone without the majority of the riftsummoner codebase. HOWEVER - JC.Touchlayer is currently pinned to our private branch of cocos2d-html5. We've modified the touch handlers to merge standard and multitouch handlers. We'll open this up shortly or create a work around so the current cocos2d-html5 can be used without our mods.
